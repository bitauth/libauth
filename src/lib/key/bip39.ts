 * mnemonic phrase.

 * string, including phrases containing an incorrect or unrecognized checksum.
 *
 * **Indiscriminate use of this function during BIP39 mnemonic phrase import
 * would prevent the use of seeds derived from such nonstandard phrases.**
 *
 * Instead, this function should be used to offer an end user the best possible
 * correction for the provided mnemonic phrase, e.g.:
 *
 * ```
 * Warning: the BIP39 mnemonic phrase you entered appears to have typographical
 * errors. The phrase could be corrected to:
 *
 * [Render the corrected phrase, emphasizing all correction ranges.]
 *
 * Correction description: [render Bip39MnemonicCorrection.description]
 *
 * Would you like to use this corrected phrase?
 *
 * [Button: "Use corrected phrase"] [Button: "Use phrase with errors"]
 * ```
 *
 * This function attempts the following corrections, returning a
 * {@link Bip39MnemonicCorrection} as soon as a BIP39 mnemonic phrase with a
 * valid checksum is produced:
 *
 * - Trim whitespace from the beginning and end of the phrase
 * - Convert the phrase to lowercase characters
 * - Identify the best candidate word list from `possibleWordLists` with which
 * to correct errors by counting exact prefix matches, e.g. `aban` is a prefix
 * match for both English and French. If two word lists share the same number of
 * matches, the earlier index in `possibleWordLists` is prioritized. (Note that
 * `100` words are shared between the French and English word lists, and `1275`
 * words are shared between the Chinese Traditional and Chinese Simplified word
 * lists. Because this function is intended to correct standard BIP39 mnemonic
 * phrases, we assume that all correct words are found in a single word list.
 * - Deduplicate spaces between words, ensuring the expected space separator is
 * used (for the Japanese word list, an ideographic space separator: `\u3000`).
 * - Attempt to verify the checksum for all valid subsets of the phrase by
 * slicing the phrase at 24, 21, 18, 15, and 12 words. In these cases, the
 * additional words may have been entered in error, or they may be part of a
 * passphrase recorded in the same location as the phrase. The returned
 * {@link Bip39MnemonicCorrection.description} indicates that the user should
 * review the source material to see if the deleted word(s) are a passphrase.
 * - For every word where an exact match is not found, develop a ranked list of
 * possible matches:
 *   - Attempt to extend the word by finding all word(s) in the selected word
 * list with a matching prefix (i.e. only the first few characters of the
 * correct word were included in the incorrect phrase). If multiple prefix
 * matches are found, rank them in word list order (in later steps, all of these
 * matches are considered to have a similarity of `1`).
 *   - If no prefix matches were found, compute the Jaro similarity between
 * the unknown word and every word in the candidate word list, adding all
 * words to the ranked list in descending-similarity, then word list order.
 * - Attempt to find a corrected phrase with the minimum possible correction by
 * validating the checksum for each candidate combination in ranked order:
 *   - Beginning with a similarity target of 1, create candidate combinations
 * by replacing unknown words with all possible matches having a similarity
 * equal to or greater than the target.
 *   - If any unknown words have no matches meeting the similarity target, lower
 * the similarity target to the value of the next-most-similar match for that
 * word, using only that match in this correction iteration.
 *   - If no phrases with a valid checksum are found, repeat these steps with
 * the lowered similarity target, excluding previously-tried combinations.
 *
 * If no plausible matches are found, or if the provided phrase has an invalid
 * word count (after attempting to correct whitespace errors), an error (string)
 * is returned.
 *
 * Note, this method does not attempt to correct mnemonic phrases with an
 * incorrect word count; in these cases, the user should be asked to either
 * identify and provide the missing words or use a dedicated brute-forcing tool
 * (if words have been lost).
