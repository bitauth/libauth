This script has access to all other template scripts and variables, but cyclical references will produce an error at compile time.\n\nIn supporting wallets, this value can be computed at address creation time, and the remaining time for which any UTXO remains \"age-locked\" can be displayed in user interfaces (by parsing the \"type bit\" and \"value\" as described in BIP68).\n\nNote, because the precise value used by `OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY` can be provided in the unlocking script, it is trivial to create an unlocking script for which a proper value for `ageLock` is not possible to determine until the spending transaction is prepared. These cases are intentionally out-of-scope for this property. Instead, `ageLock` should only be used for unlocking scripts where the expected value can be compiled at address creation time.",

Because estimate scenarios provide \"estimated\" values for all variables, this estimation can be done by a single entity without input from other entities.\n\nIf not provided, the default scenario will be used for estimation.
