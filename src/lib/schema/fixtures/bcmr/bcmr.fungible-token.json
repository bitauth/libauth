In most interfaces, it will be hidden beyond 140 characters or the first newline character.\n\nThis sentence should be hidden in user interfaces with limited space.\n\nNote that this snapshot was introduced on 2023-1-13, but the 'migrated' property indicates that the migration took place over the following month. During that month, most clients should have warned users about the upcoming change, referring users to the 'migrate' URI for information about the change. (Some clients may also offer clients the option to dismiss the migration period and immediately show the new metadata.) At 0 UTC on 2023-2-13, all clients should have switched their default display for this token to use the new metadata, i.e. ticker symbol XAMPL, with 6 decimal places. After the migrated timestamp, old metadata should only be displayed when providing historical context.",

The token was rebranded (from EXAMPLE to XAMPL) and redenominated (from 8 to 6 decimals), but the existing token category was not modified: users were not required to trade their original EXAMPLE tokens for the redenominated XAMPL tokens, their wallets simply updated the way tokens are displayed using the new metadata. Note, this entry has likely been updated by the issuer to provide useful historical information rather than attempting to preserve the precise contents of the old snapshot; the 'web' URI links to a blog post about XAMPL's re-denomination/re-brand, and outdated URI information is excluded. There may have been metadata updates published between this snapshot and the latest snapshot, but they've been excluded because registries should strive to present a useful history of only meaningful changes to identities. This information can be used in user interfaces to improve continuity following metadata updates or to offer historical context.",
