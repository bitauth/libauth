# `BCH_SPEC` Virtual Machine

This is Libauth's speculative/draft specification-based (`SPEC`), version of the Bitcoin Cash Virtual Machine (VM). Cash Improvement Proposal (CHIP) contributors are encouraged to send pull requests introducing CHIP-proposed changes into this VM for wider testing and integration.

Acceptance of any particular CHIP into Libauth's `BCH_SPEC` VM does not signal endorsement or approval by Libauth's maintainers or contributors, and CHIPs integrated into `BCH_SPEC` might never be activated on any public network.

When Libauth contributors believe a particular CHIP is likely to be included in an future upgrade, the changes proposed by that CHIP will be moved from this VM to the VM version designated for that year.
